// MAP, FILTER & REDUCE Interview Questions

// Question 1 : Array.map()

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const multiplyThree = nums.map((num, i, arr) => num * num); // cb can take num, index and array
console.log(multiplyThree);



// Question 2 : Array.filter()

const nums= [1, 2, 3, 4];

const moreThanTwo = nums.filter((num, i, arr) => num > 2);
console.log(moreThanTwo);



// Question 3 : Array.reduce()

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const sum = nums.reduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => {
  return acc + curr;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // 10



// Question 4 : Map Polyfill ->creating our own map 

Array.prototype.myMap = function (cb) {
  let temp = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    temp.push(cb(this[i], i, this));
  }

  return temp;
};

// Ques 5 : Filter Polyfill

Array.prototype.myFilter = function (cb) {
  let temp = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (cb(this[i], i, this)) temp.push(this[i]);
  }

  return temp;
};



// Question 6 : Reduce Polyfill

Array.prototype.myReduce = function (cb, initialValue) {
  var accumulator = initialValue;

  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    accumulator = accumulator ? cb(accumulator, this[i], i, this) : this[i];
  }

  return accumulator;
};



// Question 7 : map vs foreach

let students = [
  { name: "Piyush", rollNumber: 31, marks: 80 },
  { name: "Jenny", rollNumber: 15, marks: 69 },
  { name: "Kaushal", rollNumber: 16, marks: 35 },
  { name: "Dilpreet", rollNumber: 7, marks: 55 },
];

// Q1 - Return only the names of students in capital

// Solution 1 : Traditional for() loop
let names1 = [];
for (let index = 0; index < students.length; index++){
     names1.push(students[index].name.toUpperCase());
}

console.log(names1);

// Solution 2 : forEach()
let names = []
students.forEach( student => {
     names.push(student.name.toUpperCase());
})

console.log(names);

// Solution 3 : map() 
let names = students.map( stu => stu.name.toUpperCase());
console.log(names);


// Q2 - we want to get the details of students who scored more than 60 marks.

let names = students.filter(stu => stu.marks > 60);
console.log(names);


// Q3 - Get the details of students who scored more than 60 marks and have rollNumber greater than 15.

let names = students.filter(stu => stu.marks > 60 && stu.rollNumber > 20)
console.log(names);


// Q4 - Sum total of the marks of the students

let totalMarks = students.reduce( ((acc,emp) => acc+emp.marks), 0)
console.log(totalMarks);


// Q5 - Get only the names of the students who scored more than 60 marks

let names = students.filter(stu => stu.marks > 50).map(stu => stu.name)
console.log(names);


// Q6 - print the total marks of the students with marks greater than 60 after 20 marks has been added to those students who scored less than 60.

let totalMarks = studentRecords.map(function(stu){ 
    if(stu.marks < 60){
        stu.marks += 20;}
    return stu;
}).filter(stu => stu.marks > 60).reduce((acc,curr) => acc+curr.marks, 0);

console.log(totalMarks);

(Notes) Map, filter and reduce
Question 1: Array.map()
Explanation: The map() method in JavaScript creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It doesn't modify the original array but returns a new modified array based on the callback function's logic.

Question 2: Array.filter()
Explanation: The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a filtered array based on the condition specified in the callback function, where only elements that satisfy the condition are included.

Question 3: Array.reduce()
Explanation: The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It's often used for aggregating data, such as calculating a sum, by iterating through the array and accumulating the results based on the logic in the callback function.

Question 4: Map Polyfill
Explanation: This code snippet adds a custom implementation of the map() method to the Array prototype. It mimics the functionality of the native map() method by iterating through the array and applying a callback function to each element to create a new array with the modified values.

Question 5: Filter Polyfill
Explanation: Similar to the Map Polyfill, this code adds a custom implementation of the filter() method to the Array prototype. It iterates through the array and applies a callback function to each element, returning a new array containing only the elements that meet the specified condition in the callback.

Question 6: Reduce Polyfill
Explanation: This snippet introduces a custom implementation of the reduce() method for arrays. It iterates through the array, applying a callback function that performs reduction or aggregation operations, similar to the native reduce() method, and returns the final accumulated result.

Question 7: map vs foreach
Explanation: This section compares the usage of map(), forEach(), and traditional for() loops for processing data in an array of student records. It demonstrates how each method can be used to achieve specific tasks, such as transforming data, filtering based on conditions, and aggregating information, highlighting the differences in syntax and approach between these array iteration methods.
